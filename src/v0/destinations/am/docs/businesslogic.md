# Amplitude Business Logic and Mappings

## Overview

This document outlines the business logic and mappings used in the Amplitude destination integration. It covers how RudderStack events are mapped to Amplitude's API format, the specific API endpoints used for each event type, and the special handling for various event types.

## Field Mappings

### Common Field Mappings

| RudderStack Field | Amplitude Field | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `userId` | `user_id` | Required if device_id is not present |
| `anonymousId` | `device_id` | Required if user_id is not present |
| `messageId` | `insert_id` | Used for deduplication on Amplitude's side |
| `timestamp` | `time` | Converted to milliseconds if needed |
| `context.ip` | `ip` | Used for geolocation |
| `context.library` | `library` | Set to "rudderstack" |

### Device and OS Information

| RudderStack Field | Amplitude Field | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `context.os.name` | `os_name` | For web, extracted from user agent |
| `context.os.version` | `os_version` | For web, extracted from user agent |

## API Endpoints and Request Flow

### Identify Events

**Primary Endpoint**: `/2/httpapi`
**Documentation**: [Amplitude HTTP API V2](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/)

**Request Flow**:
1. Identify events are sent to the `/2/httpapi` endpoint
2. The event_type is set to `$identify` (special Amplitude identifier)
3. User traits are mapped to user_properties in the Amplitude payload
4. If Enhanced User Operations is enabled, user properties are processed with operations like $set, $setOnce, etc.

**Transformations**:
1. User traits are mapped to Amplitude user properties
2. The userId is mapped to Amplitude's user_id
3. The anonymousId is mapped to Amplitude's device_id
4. Device and OS information is extracted from context and mapped to Amplitude fields

**Example Payload**:
```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type": "$identify",
      "user_id": "user123",
      "device_id": "device456",
      "user_properties": {
        "name": "John Doe",

  ]
}
```

### Track Events

**Primary Endpoint**: `/2/httpapi`
**Documentation**: [Amplitude HTTP API V2](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/)

**Request Flow**:
1. Track events are sent to the `/2/httpapi` endpoint
2. The event name is used as the event_type in Amplitude
3. Event properties are included as event_properties in Amplitude
4. If the event has revenue, special revenue handling is applied

**Transformations**:
1. Event name is preserved as the Amplitude event_type
2. Event properties are included as Amplitude event_properties
3. User traits (if present) are included as user_properties
4. Device and OS information is extracted from context

**Example Payload**:
```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "events": [
    {

**Request Flow**:
1. Alias events are sent to the `/2/httpapi` endpoint
2. The userId is mapped to global_user_id
3. The previousId is mapped to user_id
4. If unmap is set in integrations.Amplitude, special handling is applied

**Transformations**:
1. userId is mapped to global_user_id
2. previousId is mapped to user_id
3. If unmap is set, global_user_id is removed and user_id is set to the unmap value

      "insert_id": "message123"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Special Handling

### Revenue Events

**Endpoint**: `/2/httpapi`
**Documentation**: [Amplitude HTTP API V2](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/)

Track events with revenue property receive special handling:

1. Revenue amount is extracted from properties.revenue
2. Revenue properties (price, quantity, etc.) are set at the root level
3. These properties are removed from event_properties to avoid duplication
4. If trackRevenuePerProduct is enabled, each product generates a separate revenue event

**Example Transformation**:
```javascript
// Original event
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Order Completed",
  "properties": {
    "revenue": 50.0,
    "currency": "USD",
    "products": [...]
  }
}

// Transformed to Amplitude event
{
  "event_type": "Order Completed",
  "user_id": "...",
  "device_id": "...",
  "revenue": 50.0,
  "price": 50.0,
  "quantity": 1,
  "revenue_type": "Order Completed",
  "event_properties": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "products": [...]
  }
}
```

### E-commerce Events

**Endpoint**: `/2/httpapi`
**Documentation**: [Amplitude HTTP API V2](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/)

E-commerce events receive special handling:

1. If trackProductsOnce is enabled, each product in an order generates a separate "Product Purchased" event
2. Product properties are mapped to event_properties
3. If trackRevenuePerProduct is enabled, revenue is tracked for each product

**Example Transformation**:
```javascript
// Original event
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Order Completed",
  "properties": {
    "products": [
      {
        "product_id": "123",
        "name": "Product A",
        "price": 20.0,
        "quantity": 1
      },
      {
        "product_id": "456",
        "name": "Product B",
        "price": 30.0,
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}

// Transformed to multiple Amplitude events
[
  {
    "event_type": "Order Completed",
    "user_id": "...",
    "device_id": "...",
    "event_properties": {
      "products": [...]
    }
  },
  {
    "event_type": "Product Purchased",
    "user_id": "...",
    "device_id": "...",
    "event_properties": {
      "product_id": "123",
      "name": "Product A",
      "price": 20.0,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  },
  {
    "event_type": "Product Purchased",
    "user_id": "...",
    "device_id": "...",
    "event_properties": {
      "product_id": "456",
      "name": "Product B",
      "price": 30.0,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  }
]
```

### User Property Operations

**Endpoint**: `/2/httpapi`
**Documentation**: [Amplitude HTTP API V2](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/)

When Enhanced User Operations is enabled, user properties are processed with operations:

1. Properties specified in traitsToIncrement are added to $add operation
2. Properties specified in traitsToSetOnce are added to $setOnce operation
3. Properties specified in traitsToAppend are added to $append operation
4. Properties specified in traitsToPrepend are added to $prepend operation
5. Properties specified in integrations.Amplitude.fieldsToUnset are added to $unset operation
6. Other properties are added to $set operation

**Example Transformation**:
```javascript
// Configuration
{
  "traitsToIncrement": ["visits"],
  "traitsToSetOnce": ["first_name"],
  "traitsToAppend": ["tags"],
  "traitsToPrepend": ["recent_items"]
}

// Original event
{
  "type": "identify",
  "traits": {
    "visits": 1,
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "tags": ["tag1"],
    "recent_items": ["item1"],
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "integrations": {
    "Amplitude": {
      "fieldsToUnset": ["old_field"]
    }
  }
}

// Transformed to Amplitude event
{
  "event_type": "$identify",
  "user_id": "...",
  "device_id": "...",
  "user_properties": {
    "$add": {
      "visits": 1
    },
    "$setOnce": {
      "first_name": "John"
    },
    "$append": {
      "tags": ["tag1"]
    },
    "$prepend": {
      "recent_items": ["item1"]
    },
    "$set": {
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    },
    "$unset": {
      "old_field": "-"
    }
  }
}
```

### Skip User Properties Sync

When `integrations.Amplitude.skipUserPropertiesSync` is set to true, the `$skip_user_properties_sync` flag is added to the payload. This prevents Amplitude from syncing user properties across projects.

**Example**:
```javascript
// Original event
{
  "type": "identify",
  "traits": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "integrations": {
    "Amplitude": {
      "skipUserPropertiesSync": true
    }
  }
}

// Transformed to Amplitude event
{
  "event_type": "$identify",
  "user_id": "...",
  "device_id": "...",
  "$skip_user_properties_sync": true,
  "user_properties": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

## User Deletion

**Endpoint**: `/api/2/deletions/users`
**Documentation**: [Amplitude User Privacy API](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/user-privacy-api/)

User deletion requests are processed as follows:

1. User IDs are batched (up to 100 users per batch)
2. Each batch is sent to the `/api/2/deletions/users` endpoint
3. Authentication uses both API Key and Secret Key
4. Requests include `requester: "RudderStack"` and `ignore_invalid_id: "true"`

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "user_ids": ["user123", "user456", "user789"],
  "requester": "RudderStack",
  "ignore_invalid_id": "true"
}
```
