# PR Review Comments Handler

When addressing PR review comments, follow this systematic approach:

## 1. Checkout the PR Branch


## 2. Get PR Comments
Retrieve all comments on the PR.

## 3. Process Each Comment Sequentially

For **EACH** comment, follow this exact process:

### Step A: Display Comment Information
Print the comment in this format:
```
(index). From [user] on [file]:[lines] â€” [body]
```

### Step B: Analyze the Context
- Read the file and understand the line range mentioned
- Understand the code context around the comment
- Identify what change is being requested

### Step C: Decision Making
**If you don't understand the comment:**
- Do NOT make any changes
- Ask the user for clarification
- Or ask the user to implement it themselves
- Move to the next comment

**If you understand the comment:**
- Make the change BEFORE moving to the next comment
- Ensure the change addresses the specific feedback
- Test that the change doesn't break existing functionality

### Step D: Move to Next Comment
Only after completing the current comment (either by making a change or asking for clarification), move to the next comment.

## 4. Final Summary
After processing all comments:
- Summarize what changes were made
- List which comments need the USER's attention (clarification needed or user implementation required)
- Provide a clear status of the PR review process

## Important Notes:
- Process comments **one at a time** - don't batch changes
- Always understand the context before making changes
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than guessing
- Keep track of which comments were addressed vs. need user attention
