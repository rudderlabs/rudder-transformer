          1. Follow the plan in @.github/scripts/integrations_version_audit_plan.md
          2. You MUST create Linear tickets DIRECTLY using Linear API calls during this execution
          3. DO NOT create any script files (no .js files, no audit.js, no integrations_version_audit.js)
          4. Read @.github/scripts/linearApi.js to understand the API structure
          5. Make Linear API calls directly using your capabilities to create tickets immediately after analysis
          6. Your output MUST include actual Linear ticket URLs (like https://linear.app/...)
          7. If you create a script file instead of creating tickets, the task has FAILED

          Execute the audit plan: analyze integrations, then immediately create Linear tickets using direct API calls. Include ticket URLs in your final output." --force
