## Integration Functionalities

> Facebook Pixel supports **Device mode** (web only) and **Cloud mode** (all platforms)

### Supported Message Types

- **Cloud Mode**: Identify, Track, Page, Screen
- **Device Mode** (web only): Track, Page

### Batching Support

- **Supported**: No
- **Implementation**: Uses `simpleProcessRouterDest` which provides individual event processing with concurrency, not actual batching
- **Note**: Each event is processed individually and sent as a separate API request

### Rate Limits

**No Specific Rate Limits**: According to Facebook's official documentation, there is no specific rate limit for the Conversions API.

The Facebook Pixel destination uses the Facebook Conversions API endpoint:
- **Endpoint**: `https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{PIXEL_ID}/events`
- **Method**: POST
- **Rate Limiting**: Conversions API calls are not calculated into the Graph API throttling
- **Reference**: [Facebook Conversions API Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/using-the-api/)

**Note**: While there are no specific rate limits for Conversions API, the underlying Marketing API has rate limiting based on your app's access tier. Standard access enables lower rate limiting compared to development access.

### Intermediate Calls

- **Supported**: No
- **Description**: The Facebook Pixel destination does not make any intermediate API calls. All events are sent directly to the Facebook Conversions API events endpoint.

### Proxy Delivery

- **Supported**: Yes
- **Source Code Path**: `src/v0/destinations/facebook_pixel/networkHandler.js`
- **Implementation**: Uses shared Facebook utilities network handler

### User Deletion

- **Supported**: No
- **Note**: The Facebook Pixel destination does not implement user deletion functionality. No `deleteUsers.js` file is present in the destination directory.

### OAuth Support

- **Supported**: No
- **Authentication**: Uses access token-based authentication
- **Note**: The destination configuration does not include OAuth authentication type in the database configuration

### Additional Functionalities

#### PII Data Handling

- **Automatic Hashing**: The destination automatically hashes PII data using SHA-256
- **Supported PII Fields**: email, phone, gender, first name, last name, city, country, state, zip, birthday
- **Configuration Options**:
  - Blacklist specific properties (with optional hashing)
  - Whitelist specific properties to include
  - Custom hashing behavior through integrations object

#### Event Duration Validation

- **Standard Events**: Events must be sent within 7 days of their occurrence or up to 1 minute in the future
- **Physical Store Events**: Events with `action_source` set to `physical_store` must be sent within 62 days of their occurrence
- **Future Events**: All events can be sent up to 1 minute in the future
- **Implementation**: The `verifyEventDuration` function validates event timestamps based on action source

#### Standard Event Mapping

- **E-commerce Events**: Automatic mapping of RudderStack e-commerce events to Facebook standard events:
  - `Product List Viewed` → `ViewContent`
  - `Product Viewed` → `ViewContent`
  - `Product Added` → `AddToCart`
  - `Order Completed` → `Purchase`
  - `Products Searched` → `Search`
  - `Checkout Started` → `InitiateCheckout`

#### Action Source Detection

- **Automatic Detection**: The destination automatically sets the `action_source` parameter based on the event channel:
  - Web events: `website`
  - Mobile events: `app`
  - Server events: `other`

#### Custom Data Processing

- **Property Flattening**: Event properties are flattened for Facebook's API format
- **Reserved Properties**: Certain properties (`opt_out`, `event_id`, `action_source`) are excluded from custom data
- **Special Arrays**: Properties like `content_ids` and `contents` are preserved as arrays without flattening

### Validations

#### Required Fields
- **Pixel ID**: Must be provided in destination configuration
- **Access Token**: Required for cloud mode authentication
- **Event Type**: Must be one of: identify, track, page, screen
- **Event Name**: Required for track events and must be a string

#### Event-Specific Validations
- **Identify Events**: Require `advancedMapping` to be enabled in configuration
- **Track Events**: Must have a valid event name property
- **Standard Events**: Must have properties after excluding reserved fields

#### Data Validations
- **Event Duration**: Events must be within 7 days of occurrence or up to 1 minute in the future
- **PII Data**: Automatically validated and hashed according to Facebook requirements
- **User Data**: External ID is required and derived from userId, traits, or anonymousId

## General Queries

### Event Ordering

#### Track, Page, Screen Events
- **Required**: No strict ordering required for most track events
- **Reasoning**: Facebook Pixel events are primarily used for conversion tracking and audience building. The timestamp is included with each event, allowing Facebook to process events in chronological order regardless of delivery order.
- **Exception**: Events that update user attributes (when included with track events) may benefit from ordering to prevent older data from overwriting newer data.

#### Identify Events
- **Required**: Yes, ordering is recommended
- **Reasoning**: Identify events update user profiles and attributes. Out-of-order delivery could result in older user data overwriting newer information, leading to incorrect user profiles.

### Data Replay Feasibility

#### Missing Data Replay
- **Feasible**: Yes, for most event types
- **Reasoning**: Since Facebook Pixel events include timestamps and don't require strict ordering (except for user attribute updates), missing historical data can generally be replayed safely.
- **Limitation**: Events must be within 7 days of their occurrence due to Facebook's event duration validation.

#### Already Delivered Data Replay
- **Not Recommended**: Replaying already delivered data will create duplicate events
- **Reasoning**: Facebook treats each event as unique based on the event data and timestamp. There is no built-in deduplication mechanism in Facebook Pixel API.
- **Impact**: Duplicate events can skew conversion metrics, audience sizes, and campaign optimization.

### Multiplexing

- **Supported**: No
- **Description**: The Facebook Pixel destination does not generate multiple API calls from a single input event. Each RudderStack event results in exactly one API call to Facebook's Conversions API.

#### Event Processing Flow

1. **Single Event Processing**:
   ```
   Input: RudderStack event (Identify/Track/Page/Screen)
   Output: Single API call to /events endpoint
   Multiplexing: NO
   ```

2. **No Intermediate Calls**: Unlike some destinations that make preliminary API calls for identity resolution or data fetching, Facebook Pixel sends all data directly to the events endpoint.

3. **Batch Processing**: Each event in a batch is processed individually, resulting in separate API calls rather than a single batched request.
