## Integration Functionalities

> Google Ads Remarketing Lists supports **Cloud mode** only

### Supported Message Types

- **Audience List**: For managing user lists with add/remove operations
- **Record**: For VDM v2 (Warehouse) data synchronization

### Batching Support

- **Supported**: Yes
- **Message Types**: Both Audience List and Record events
- **Batch Limits**:
  - User identifiers: 20 per operation (automatically chunked)
  - Operations: Multiple operations per job, subject to API quotas
  - Total user identifiers: 100,000 per offline user data job
  - The destination automatically chunks user identifiers into groups of 20, with each chunk becoming a separate operation within the same job

### Rate Limits

The Google Ads API enforces the following limits for offline user data jobs:

| Operation Type | Rate Limit | Batch Limits | Description |
|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Create Offline User Data Job | Standard API limits | - | Creates a new job for user list operations |
| Add Operations | Standard API limits | 100,000 user identifiers total | Adds user data operations to a job |
| Run Job | Standard API limits | - | Executes the job with all operations |

**Important Notes:**
- Jobs may take 6+ hours to complete processing
- Daily API operation limits apply based on developer token access level
- Basic access: 15,000 API operations per day
- Each job creation, operation addition, and job execution counts as separate API operations
- Maximum 100,000 user identifiers per job
- Concurrent modification errors may occur with simultaneous updates

**Error Handling:**
- `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION` errors are retried with 500 status
- Partial failure errors are handled gracefully
- Invalid user identifiers are logged and skipped

### Intermediate Calls

- **Supported**: Yes
- **Use Case**: Three-step process for uploading user data to Customer Match lists

#### Offline User Data Job Flow
1. **Create Job**: `/customers/{customerId}/offlineUserDataJobs:create`
   - Creates a new offline user data job
   - Specifies the target user list and consent information

2. **Add Operations**: `/customers/{customerId}/offlineUserDataJobs/{jobId}:addOperations`
   - Adds user identifier operations (create/remove) to the job
   - Supports batching of operations

3. **Run Job**: `/customers/{customerId}/offlineUserDataJobs/{jobId}:run`
   - Executes the job to process all operations
   - Asynchronous operation that may take hours to complete

### Proxy Delivery

- **Supported**: Yes
- **Source Code Path**: `src/v0/destinations/google_adwords_remarketing_lists/networkHandler.js`
- **Implementation**: Custom proxy handler for the three-step offline user data job process

### User Deletion

- **Supported**: Yes (via remove operations)
- **Method**: Remove operations in offline user data jobs
- **Scope**: Individual users can be removed using their identifiers

### Additional Functionalities

#### User Identifier Types

- **Email Addresses**: Hashed email addresses (SHA-256)
- **Phone Numbers**: Hashed phone numbers (SHA-256)
- **Address Information**: First name, last name, country code, postal code
- **Third Party User IDs**: For userID type lists
- **Mobile Device IDs**: For mobileDeviceID type lists

#### Consent Management

- **User Data Consent**: Controls consent for ad user data usage
- **Personalization Consent**: Controls consent for ad personalization
- **Integration**: Supports OneTrust, Ketch, and custom consent providers

#### Data Hashing

- **Automatic Hashing**: Email and phone numbers are automatically SHA-256 hashed
- **Configurable**: Can be disabled via `isHashRequired` setting
- **Normalized**: Data is normalized before hashing (lowercase, trimmed)
- **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256 with UTF-8 encoding

#### Validations

- **Customer ID**: Must be numeric, hyphens automatically removed
- **List ID**: Required for cloud mode operations
- **User Identifiers**: Must match configured user schema
- **Email Format**: Validated before hashing
- **Phone Format**: Normalized before hashing
- **Address Info**: Country code must be valid ISO format
- **Consent Values**: Must be one of the specified enum values

#### Data Processing

- **Chunking**: User identifiers automatically chunked into groups of 20 per operation
- **Deduplication**: Google Ads handles duplicate user identifiers
- **Normalization**: Email addresses converted to lowercase, phone numbers normalized
- **Error Handling**: Partial failures supported, invalid identifiers logged and skipped

## General Queries

### Event Ordering

#### Audience List Events
**Event ordering is NOT strictly required** for Customer Match user list operations. Google Ads Customer Match is designed to handle:

- **Add Operations**: Users are added to the list regardless of order
- **Remove Operations**: Users are removed from the list regardless of order
- **Duplicate Operations**: Google handles deduplication automatically

The destination processes operations in batches, and Google Ads applies the final state based on the most recent job execution.

#### Record Events (VDM v2)
**Event ordering is NOT strictly required** for record-based operations as they follow the same Customer Match principles.

### Data Replay Feasibility

#### Missing Data Replay
- **Feasible**: Yes, missing data can be replayed safely
- **Reason**: Customer Match operations are idempotent - adding existing users or removing non-existent users doesn't cause issues
- **Recommendation**: Safe to replay missing audience list or record events

#### Already Delivered Data Replay
- **Feasible**: Yes, with considerations
- **Add Operations**: Replaying add operations is safe as Google Ads handles duplicates
- **Remove Operations**: Replaying remove operations may unintentionally remove users that were re-added
- **Recommendation**: Generally safe for add operations, use caution with remove operations

### Multiplexing

- **Supported**: Yes (limited scenarios)
- **Description**: Single input events can generate multiple output API calls in specific cases

#### Multiplexing Scenarios

1. **Audience List Events**:
   - **Multiplexing**: YES (when both add and remove operations are present)
   - Single event with both add AND remove operations creates two separate offline user data jobs
   - Single event with only add OR only remove operations creates one offline user data job
   - Multiple operations of the same type within an event are batched into a single job

2. **Record Events**:
   - **Multiplexing**: NO
   - Each record event creates operations for a single offline user data job
   - Multiple records are batched together but represent one logical operation

## FAQ

### Why do jobs take so long to complete?
Google Ads offline user data jobs are processed asynchronously and may take 6+ hours to complete. This is a limitation of the Google Ads API, not the RudderStack integration. The job status can be monitored through the Google Ads API.

### Can I use the same list for multiple campaigns?
Yes, once a Customer Match list is created and populated, it can be used for targeting across multiple campaigns and ad groups within the same Google Ads account.

### What happens if I send duplicate user identifiers?
Google Ads automatically handles duplicate user identifiers. Sending the same user multiple times will not create duplicates in the list.

### How do I handle consent requirements?
Configure the `userDataConsent` and `personalizationConsent` settings according to your privacy compliance requirements. These settings are passed to Google Ads with each job.

### Why are some users not being added to the list?
Common reasons include:
- Invalid email format or phone number format
- Users not matching Google's Customer Match requirements
- Insufficient user data for matching
- Privacy settings preventing matching

### Can I remove all users from a list?
Yes, use the `remove_all` operation in an offline user data job. This operation must be the first operation in the job if other operations are included.
