# Integration Version Audit with Linear Ticket Management

## Overview

Conduct an AI-assisted audit of all integrations from `.github/scripts/versions.json`, use Cursor's codebase search and documentation walkthrough capabilities to analyze deprecation risks and version information, then create a master Linear ticket with subtickets for each integration requiring action using the `.github/scripts/linearApi.js` helper module.

## Key Files

- **Data Source**: `.github/scripts/versions.json` - Contains integrations with version info, sunset dates, and documentation links.
- **Linear API Helper**: `.github/scripts/linearApi.js` - Helper module for creating and managing Linear tickets via API

**Important**: The workflow is performed entirely through AI-assisted analysis using Cursor's capabilities, with direct calls to `linearApi.js` functions for ticket creation.

**Environment Variables Required**:

- `LINEAR_API_KEY` - Required, Linear API key for authentication
- `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` - Required, Linear team ID (UUID) where tickets will be created

**Execution Context**: When calling `linearApi.js` functions, ensure the correct path is used:

- If executing from `.github/scripts/` directory: `require('./linearApi')`
- If executing from project root: `require('./.github/scripts/linearApi')`
- The `linearApi.js` file must be in the same directory or path must be adjusted accordingly

## Priority and Due Date Mapping

### Priority Levels:

- **Urgent (1)**: Deprecated with sunset date < 3 months
- **High (2)**: Deprecated with sunset date < 6 months
- **Medium (3)**: Deprecated with sunset date < 12 months OR using significantly outdated version
- **Low (4)**: Minor version updates, no immediate deprecation risk

### Due Date Logic:

- **All priorities**: Due date = sunset date (even if it’s in the past)
- **No sunset date or unparseable**: leave `dueDate` null (no fallback)

**Note**: Priority is still calculated from days-until-sunset; the due date simply mirrors the sunset date, and is omitted when no sunset is available.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Parsing

1. **Parse versions.json**

- Read and parse `.github/scripts/versions.json`
- Extract for each integration:
- Destination
- Version currently referred in CloudMode Services
- Link to check Versions documentation
- Latest Version rolled out
- Sunset Date Current Version used in backend

2. **Detect and filter non-versioned APIs**

- Before proceeding with analysis, identify and filter out destinations that use non-versioned APIs
- **Non-versioned detection logic**: A destination is considered non-versioned if any of the following conditions are met:
  - `"Version currently referred in CloudMode Services"` field contains (case-insensitive):
    - "not versioned"
    - "not applicable" (when in context of versioning)
  - `"Latest Version rolled out"` field contains (case-insensitive):
    - "not versioned"
    - "not applicable" (when followed by "no versioning" or similar)
    - "n/a" (when followed by "no versioning" or "versioned api")
    - "no versioning"
    - "continuously updated"
    - "custom endpoint" or "custom configurable endpoint"
    - "account-specific endpoint"
  - `"Sunset Date Current Version used in backend"` field contains (case-insensitive):
    - "not applicable"
    - "n/a (no versioned api"
    - "no versioned api to sunset"
- **Filtering**: Remove all non-versioned destinations from the analysis pipeline
- **Logging**: Log the count and names of skipped destinations for transparency:
  ```javascript
  const skippedDestinations = allDestinations.filter(isNonVersioned);
  console.log(
    `Skipped ${skippedDestinations.length} non-versioned API destinations: ${skippedDestinations.map((d) => d.Destination).join(', ')}`,
  );
  ```
- Only proceed with versioned destinations for subsequent analysis phases

3. **Enforce full coverage of versioned destinations**

- After filtering, build the set of versioned destinations (`versionedDestinations`)
- During analysis, track every destination actually processed (`analyzedDestinations`)
- **Hard rule**: if any versioned destination is missing from `analyzedDestinations`, fail the audit immediately (exit non-zero) and log the missing names for debugging
- Example check:
  ```javascript
  const versionedNames = new Set(versionedDestinations.map((d) => d.Destination));
  const analyzedNames = new Set(analyzedDestinations.map((d) => d.Destination));
  const missing = [...versionedNames].filter((n) => !analyzedNames.has(n));
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    console.error(`Coverage check failed. Missing analyses for: ${missing.join(', ')}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  ```

### Phase 2: Analysis with Cursor

4. **Analyze integrations using Cursor**

- For each integration from versions.json (non-versioned destinations already filtered out):
  - **Codebase Search**: Use Cursor's semantic codebase search to:
    - Find integration implementation files
    - Search for version indicators (API endpoints, SDK versions, version constants)
    - Identify current version usage in the codebase
    - Locate relevant configuration and transformation files
  - **Documentation Walkthrough**: Use Cursor's `web_search` tool to:
    - Search and review official documentation links from versions.json
    - Search for and analyze migration guides and changelogs
    - Search for deprecation timelines and breaking changes information
    - Search for API/SDK version compatibility information
    - Verify latest version availability and release dates
    - Check for any announced deprecations or sunset dates not captured in versions.json
    - Gather detailed version upgrade requirements and migration steps
  - **Cross-reference**: Compare versions.json data with findings from codebase search and documentation
  - **Identify gaps**: Flag discrepancies between versions.json, codebase implementation, and official documentation

### Phase 3: Priority Calculation and Categorization

5. **Calculate priority and due dates**

- Parse sunset dates (see Date Parsing section for supported formats)
- For multiple sunset dates in one field, use the earliest one for priority calculation
- Calculate days until sunset (from today to sunset date)
- Extract major version numbers for comparison:
  - "v22.0" → 22
  - "22" → 22
  - "2025-04-15" → 2025 (use year for date-based versions)
  - "v1.76.0" → 1
  - "v2025.07" → 2025
  - If version strings don't contain numbers, compare as strings
- Apply priority logic:
  - **Urgent (1)**: < 90 days until sunset → Due: Tomorrow (next day)
  - **High (2)**: 90-180 days until sunset → Due: sunset date - 90 days (approximately 3 months before)
  - **Medium (3)**: 180-365 days until sunset OR version gap > 2 major versions → Due: sunset date - 180 days (approximately 6 months before)
  - **Low (4)**: > 365 days until sunset OR minor version updates → Due: 12 months from analysis date
- Handle edge cases: "TBD", "Not mentioned", "NA", "n/a", "Not applicable", ambiguous dates → Mark as Low priority (4) or Unknown category

6. **Categorize integrations**

Categorization logic:

- **Action Required**:
  - Has a sunset date (regardless of how far in the future)
  - Current version differs from latest version (and latest is not "NA"/"n/a")
  - Version gap > 2 major versions (even without sunset date)
  - Any deprecation risk or configuration issues identified
- **No Action**:
  - Up-to-date (current version matches latest version)
  - No sunset date announced
  - No version gap or only minor version differences
  - Compliant with latest standards
- **Unknown**:
  - Missing version information in versions.json
  - Unclear or ambiguous sunset dates that cannot be parsed
  - Missing documentation links
  - Needs manual review to determine status

### Phase 4: Linear Ticket Creation

7. **Create master Linear ticket**

- Use `.github/scripts/linearApi.js` helper module directly (no script execution needed)
- Before creating the ticket, query for required IDs:
  - Query for "Ongoing integrations improvements" state ID
  - Query for current authenticated user ID
  - Query for current cycle ID
- Call `createIssue()` function programmatically using Node.js:

  ```javascript
  const {
    createIssue,
    getStateId,
    getCurrentUserId,
    getCurrentCycleId,
  } = require('./.github/scripts/linearApi');
  // Note: Path may need adjustment based on execution context
  // Ensure LINEAR_API_KEY and LINEAR_TEAM_ID environment variables are set

  // Query for required IDs
  const statusStateId = await getStateId('Ongoing integrations improvements', LINEAR_TEAM_ID);
  const currentUserId = await getCurrentUserId();
  const currentCycleId = await getCurrentCycleId(LINEAR_TEAM_ID);

  // If any IDs are null, log warnings but proceed with ticket creation
  if (!statusStateId)
    console.warn(
      'Warning: Could not find "Ongoing integrations improvements" state. Ticket will be created without status.',
    );
  if (!currentUserId)
    console.warn(
      'Warning: Could not retrieve current user ID. Ticket will be created without assignee.',
    );
  if (!currentCycleId)
    console.warn('Warning: Could not find current cycle. Ticket will be created without cycle.');

  const masterTicket = await createIssue({
    title: 'Integration Version Audit [Rudder Transformer] [Current Date in DD/MM/YYYY]',
    description: masterDescription, // Use Master Ticket Description Template (see below)
    priority: 3, // Medium priority
    stateId: statusStateId, // Status: Ongoing integrations improvements
    cycleId: currentCycleId, // Current cycle
    projectId: process.env.LINEAR_PROJECT_ID || null, // Optional: set project if provided
    labelIds: [], // Optional: add label IDs if labels exist in Linear
  });
  ```

  - Store returned ticket ID (`masterTicket.id`) for use as parent in subtickets
  - The returned object includes: `id`, `identifier` (e.g., "INT-4499"), `title`, and `url`
  - **Master Ticket Configuration**:
    - **Status**: Ongoing integrations improvements (queried via `getStateId('Ongoing integrations improvements', LINEAR_TEAM_ID)`)
    - **Priority**: Medium (3)
    - **Cycle**: Current (queried via `getCurrentCycleId(LINEAR_TEAM_ID)`)
    - **Project**: Uses `LINEAR_PROJECT_ID` if provided (optional)

8. **Create subtickets for each integration requiring action**

- For each integration categorized as "Action Required":
- Call `createIssue()` function directly:
  ```javascript
  await createIssue({
    title: `${integrationName} Version Audit [Rudder Transformer]`, // No brackets needed, Linear will format
    description: ticketDescription, // Use Individual Integration Ticket Template (see below)
    parentId: masterTicket.id, // From step 5
    priority: calculatedPriority, // 1-4 based on urgency (1=Urgent, 4=Low)
    dueDate: calculatedDueDate, // ISO format string (YYYY-MM-DD) or null
    labelIds: [], // Optional: add label IDs if labels exist
  });
  ```
- Create all subtickets in batch after analysis completes
  - Handle errors gracefully: if one ticket creation fails, log the error and continue with remaining integrations
  - Consider adding a small delay between ticket creations to avoid rate limiting
  - **Verification**: After all tickets are created, verify that:
    - Master ticket was created successfully (check for ticket ID and URL)
    - All integrations requiring action have corresponding subtickets
    - Each subticket contains detailed analysis from codebase search and web_search findings
    - Priority and due dates are correctly assigned based on sunset dates and version gaps
    - Ticket descriptions include all relevant information from documentation review

9. **Log analysis summary**

   - After all analysis and ticket creation is complete, log a summary of what was done to console:

   ```javascript
   console.log('\n=== Integration Version Audit Summary ===');
   console.log(`Total Integrations in versions.json: ${totalIntegrationsInFile}`);
   console.log(`Skipped (Non-versioned APIs): ${skippedCount}`);
   if (skippedCount > 0) {
     console.log(`  - ${skippedDestinations.map((d) => d.Destination).join(', ')}`);
   }
   console.log(`Coverage validation: ${coveragePassed ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED'}`);
   if (!coveragePassed) {
     console.log(`  Missing analyses for: ${missingDestinations.join(', ')}`);
   }
   console.log(`Total Integrations Analyzed: ${totalIntegrations}`);
   console.log(`\nBy Category:`);
   console.log(`  - Action Required: ${actionRequiredCount}`);
   console.log(`  - No Action: ${noActionCount}`);
   console.log(`  - Unknown: ${unknownCount}`);
   console.log(`\nBy Priority:`);
   console.log(`  - Urgent (1): ${urgentCount}`);
   console.log(`  - High (2): ${highCount}`);
   console.log(`  - Medium (3): ${mediumCount}`);
   console.log(`  - Low (4): ${lowCount}`);
   console.log(`\nTickets Created:`);
   console.log(`  - Master Ticket: ${masterTicket.identifier} - ${masterTicket.url}`);
   console.log(`  - Subtickets: ${subticketsCreated} tickets created`);
   if (errors.length > 0) {
     console.log(`\nErrors Encountered: ${errors.length}`);
     errors.forEach((err) => console.log(`  - ${err}`));
   }
   console.log('\n=== End of Audit Summary ===\n');
   ```

   - Logging should include:
     - Total integrations in versions.json file
     - Count and list of skipped non-versioned destinations
     - Total integrations analyzed (after filtering)
     - Breakdown by category (Action Required, No Action, Unknown)
     - Breakdown by priority (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
     - Master ticket identifier and URL
     - Number of subtickets created
     - List of any errors encountered during the process
     - All logging is done via `console.log()` - no files are created

9. **Verify analysis completion and ticket creation**

   - After logging the summary, verify that the audit process completed successfully:
   - **Analysis Verification**:
     - All versioned integrations from versions.json were analyzed (non-versioned destinations correctly filtered out)
     - Codebase search was performed for each integration
     - Web search was used to review documentation for version details
     - Priorities and due dates were calculated for all integrations
     - All integrations were properly categorized
   - **Ticket Creation Verification**:
     - Master ticket was created and has a valid ID and URL
     - Number of subtickets created matches the number of integrations requiring action
     - Each subticket contains:
       - Detailed analysis from codebase search findings
       - Information gathered from web_search of documentation
       - Correct priority level based on sunset dates and version gaps
       - Appropriate due date calculated from priority logic
       - Complete ticket description with all relevant details
   - **Error Handling**: If verification fails, log specific errors and ensure all available information is still captured in created tickets
   - **Completion**: The audit is considered complete only when:
     - All analysis steps are finished
     - All required Linear tickets are created successfully
     - Summary is logged to console
     - Any errors are documented in the summary log

**linearApi.js Functions Available:**

- `createIssue({ title, description, parentId, priority, labelIds, dueDate, stateId, assigneeId, cycleId })` - Create a new Linear ticket
  - **Note**: Team ID is taken from `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` environment variable (not passed as parameter)
  - Parameters:
    - `title` (required), `description` (required)
    - `parentId` (optional), `priority` (optional, default: 3)
    - `labelIds` (optional array), `dueDate` (optional ISO string)
    - `stateId` (optional) - State/workflow status ID (e.g., "triage")
    - `assigneeId` (optional) - User ID to assign the ticket to
    - `cycleId` (optional) - Cycle ID to associate the ticket with
- `getStateId(stateName, teamId)` - Query Linear API to find state ID by name (e.g., "Ongoing integrations improvements")

## Analysis and Ticket Creation Workflow

### AI-Assisted Analysis Process

The audit is performed through AI-assisted analysis using Cursor's capabilities:

1. **Parses versions.json**: Extracts integration data (names, versions, sunset dates, documentation links)
2. **Filters non-versioned APIs**: Identifies and skips destinations that don't use versioned APIs (e.g., Braze, GA4, PostHog, Mixpanel, Iterable, June, SFTP, Slack, Movable Ink, Wunderkind)
3. **Cursor Codebase Search**: Uses Cursor's semantic search to:
   - Find integration implementations across the codebase
   - Search for version-specific patterns (API endpoints, SDK versions, constants)
   - Identify current version usage and configuration
   - Discover related files and dependencies
4. **Cursor Documentation Walkthrough**: Uses Cursor's `web_search` tool to:
   - Search and navigate official documentation links from versions.json
   - Search for and review migration guides and changelogs
   - Search for deprecation timelines and breaking changes information
   - Cross-reference multiple documentation sources via web search
   - Verify version information and gather detailed upgrade requirements
5. **Calculates priorities**: Parses sunset dates, calculates urgency, determines due dates based on analysis findings
6. **Creates Linear tickets**: Uses `linearApi.js` helper module to programmatically create tickets with comprehensive analysis results
7. **Logs analysis summary**: Outputs a summary of the audit process to console, including statistics, skipped non-versioned destinations, ticket information, and any errors encountered

### Date Parsing

Handle various date formats when parsing sunset dates. When multiple dates are present (e.g., multiple version ranges), use the earliest sunset date for priority calculation:

**Supported Formats:**

- "April 30, 2026" - Standard date format
- "April 28th, 2026" - Date with ordinal suffix
- "September 2025" - Month and year only (use last day of month)
- "@May 6, 2025" - Date with @ prefix
- "v17 @June 4, 2025" - Version prefix with date
- "2023-02-22 → till 2025-02-22" - Date range (use end date)
- "2023-02-22 → till 2025-02-22\n2024-06-15 → till 2026-06-15" - Multiple ranges (use earliest end date)

**Parsing Rules:**

- Extract the end date from ranges (after "→" or "till")
- For multiple ranges, use the earliest sunset date for urgency calculation
- For month-only dates (e.g., "September 2025"), use the last day of that month
- Handle ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) in dates

### Linear API Integration

Use the existing `.github/scripts/linearApi.js` module for ticket creation. Functions are called directly during the AI-assisted analysis process:

- **Module exports**: `createIssue`, `listIssuesByParent`, `updateIssueDescription`
- **Environment Variables Required**:
  - `LINEAR_API_KEY` - Linear API key for authentication (required)
  - `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` - Linear team ID (UUID) where tickets will be created (required)
- **Usage**: Functions are called directly from the analysis workflow using Node.js, not through a separate script execution
- **No Script Required**: The audit process uses `linearApi.js` functions directly; no separate audit script file (like `audit.js`) is needed or should be created

## Output Deliverables

1. **Master Linear Ticket**: Executive summary with all integrations categorized, created via `linearApi.js`
2. **Sub-tickets**: Individual tickets for each integration requiring action, created via `linearApi.js` with proper parent-child relationships
3. **Ticket URLs**: All created tickets include URLs for easy access and tracking
4. **Analysis Summary Log**: Summary of the audit process logged to console, including:
   - Total integrations in versions.json file
   - Count and list of skipped non-versioned destinations
   - Total integrations analyzed (after filtering)
   - Breakdown by category (Action Required, No Action, Unknown)
   - Breakdown by priority (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
   - Master ticket identifier and URL
   - Number of subtickets created
   - Any errors encountered during the process
   - **Note**: This is logged to console only (via `console.log()`), no files are created

## Notes

- **Workflow**: AI-assisted analysis using Cursor for codebase search and documentation walkthrough, then create master ticket with subtickets using `linearApi.js`
- **No Script File Required**: This audit process does not require creating or running any script file (such as `audit.js`). All analysis is performed through AI-assisted methods using Cursor, and tickets are created by calling `linearApi.js` functions directly during the analysis process.
- **Analysis Tools**:
  - **Cursor Codebase Search**: Semantic search across the codebase to find integration implementations and version usage
  - **Cursor Web Search**: Use `web_search` tool to search and review official documentation, migration guides, changelogs, and version information from external sources
- **Data Source**: Use local `versions.json` file as primary data source, supplemented by Cursor analysis
- **Linear API**: Uses existing `.github/scripts/linearApi.js` helper module (API key already configured). Functions are called directly during the AI-assisted analysis process.
- **Ticket Creation**: Tickets are created programmatically via Linear GraphQL API through the helper module, called directly from the analysis workflow
- **Error Handling**:
- Ambiguous sunset dates → Mark as "Unknown" category, Low priority (4)
- Missing version info → Categorize as "Unknown", request manual review in ticket description
- API errors (Linear API failures) → Log error with integration name, continue with remaining integrations, note failures in summary
- Codebase search returns no results → Still create ticket if action required, note in ticket that "Integration may not be implemented in codebase or uses different naming"
- Multiple sunset dates in one field → Use earliest sunset date for priority calculation
- Invalid date formats → Mark as "Unknown" category, include original date string in ticket for manual review
- **Edge Cases**: Handle "NA", "n/a", "Not applicable", "TBD", empty strings gracefully when parsing data
- **Non-versioned APIs**: Destinations with non-versioned APIs are automatically detected and skipped from analysis. These include destinations where versioning is explicitly marked as "not versioned", "not applicable", "no versioning", or similar indicators. No tickets are created for these destinations as they don't require version tracking or migration analysis.
