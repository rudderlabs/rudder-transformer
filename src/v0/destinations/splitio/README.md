# Split.io Destination

Implementation in **JavaScript**

## Configuration

### Required Settings

- **API Key**: Required for authentication with Split.io Events API
  - Must be a valid SDK API key with events tracking permissions
  - Used for Bearer token authentication in API requests

- **Traffic Type**: Specifies the default traffic type for events
  - Must match the names of Traffic Types defined in your Split.io instance
  - Used as fallback when traffic type is not provided in event payload
  - Example: `user`, `account`, `session`

### Optional Settings

- **Environment**: Specifies the Split.io environment for events
  - Must match the names of Environments defined in your Split.io instance
  - If not provided, events will be sent without environment specification
  - Example: `production`, `staging`, `development`

## Integration Functionalities

> Split.io supports **Cloud mode** only

### Supported Message Types

- Identify
- Track
- Page
- Screen
- Group

### Batching Support

- **Supported**: No (current implementation)
- **Reason**: Current implementation uses individual API calls for each event
- **Implementation**: Uses `simpleProcessRouterDest` for processing events individually
- **Available Alternative**: Split.io provides a bulk events API endpoint (`/api/events/bulk`) that supports batching, but the current RudderStack implementation does not utilize it

### Rate Limits

The Split.io Events API does not enforce rate limits:

| Endpoint | Event Types | Rate Limit | Description |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| `/api/events` | All supported event types | **No rate limit** | Used for sending individual events to Split.io |
| `/api/events/bulk` | All supported event types | **No rate limit** | Used for sending bulk events to Split.io |

According to Split.io's official documentation: "There is no rate limit on the events API. It can handle any volume of load of events."

#### Payload Size Recommendations

While there are no rate limits, Split.io recommends:
- Keep individual payload sizes under **1 megabyte** for optimal performance
- Use bulk events endpoint for high-volume event ingestion

#### Rate Limiting for Other APIs

Note that rate limiting applies to Split.io's Admin API (used for feature flag management) but does not affect the Events API used by this destination.

### Intermediate Calls

- **Supported**: No
- **Description**: Split.io destination makes direct API calls to the events endpoint without any intermediate processing calls

### Proxy Delivery

- **Supported**: Yes
- **Source Code Path**: Uses standard RudderStack proxy delivery mechanism

### User Deletion

- **Supported**: No
- **Reason**: Split.io Events API does not provide user deletion capabilities through the events endpoint

### Additional Functionalities

#### Event Type ID Validation

- **Validation Rule**: Event Type ID must match the regex pattern `/^[a-zA-Z0-9][-_\.a-zA-Z0-9]{0,62}$/`
- **Requirements**:
  - **63 characters or fewer** (as per Split.io official documentation)
  - Starts with a letter or number
  - Contains only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period
- **Automatic Processing**: Spaces in event names are automatically replaced with underscores

> **Note**: The current implementation uses a slightly different regex pattern (`/^[\dA-Za-z][\w.-]{0,79}$/`) which allows up to 80 characters. This discrepancy exists between the code implementation and Split.io's official documentation.

#### Property Flattening

- **Supported**: Yes
- **Description**: Nested properties in events are automatically flattened using dot notation
- **Example**: `property1.property4.subProp1.a` for nested objects

#### Event Type Prefixing

- **Page Events**: Automatically prefixed with `Viewed_` and suffixed with `_page`
- **Screen Events**: Automatically prefixed with `Viewed_` and suffixed with `_screen`
- **Track Events**: No automatic prefixing applied

## General Queries

### Event Ordering

#### All Event Types
- **Required**: No
- **Reason**: Split.io Events API accepts events with timestamps and processes them based on the provided timestamp
- **Implementation**: Events include timestamp field for proper chronological ordering in Split.io

### Data Replay Feasibility

#### Missing Data Replay
- **Feasible**: Yes
- **Reason**: Events can be replayed with historical timestamps as Split.io accepts timestamp field in event payload
- **Implementation**: Split.io processes events based on the provided timestamp, allowing for historical data ingestion

#### Already Delivered Data Replay
- **Feasible**: Yes, but creates duplicates
- **Behavior**: Split.io treats all events as unique and does not deduplicate based on event content or IDs
- **Considerations**:
  - Replayed events will be processed as new events, potentially affecting metrics calculations
  - No built-in deduplication mechanism in Split.io Events API
  - Consider the impact on experiment results and metrics when replaying data

### Multiplexing

- **Supported**: No
- **Description**: Split.io destination generates exactly one API call per input event
- **Implementation**: Each RudderStack event maps to a single Split.io events API call

## Version Information

### Current Version

- **API Version**: Split.io Events API does not use versioned endpoints
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `https://events.split.io/api/events` - Single event endpoint (currently implemented)
  - `https://events.split.io/api/events/bulk` - Bulk events endpoint (available but not implemented)
- **Deprecation**: No deprecation schedule announced for Events API

### Version Compatibility

- **Current Implementation**: Uses the standard Split.io Events API (single event endpoint)
- **Available Enhancements**: Bulk events endpoint available for potential batching implementation
- **Future Versions**: Split.io Events API is stable with no announced breaking changes

## FAQ

### Q: Can I send events without a userId?
**A**: No, Split.io requires a `key` field (mapped from userId) for all events to associate them with a user or entity.

### Q: How are nested properties handled?
**A**: Nested properties are automatically flattened using dot notation. For example, `user.profile.name` becomes `"user.profile.name"` in the properties object.

### Q: What happens if I don't provide a traffic type?
**A**: The destination will use the `trafficType` configured in the destination settings as a fallback.

### Q: Can I send historical events?
**A**: Yes, you can include a `timestamp` field in your events to send historical data. Split.io will process events based on their timestamp.

### Q: Are there any limits on property names or values?
**A**: Yes, Split.io enforces the following limits:
- Maximum 300 properties per event type
- Each property has a 256 character limit
- Supported property types: strings, numbers, and booleans

### Q: How do I track revenue or conversion values?
**A**: Include `revenue`, `value`, or `total` in your event properties. These will be mapped to Split.io's `value` field for metrics calculation.
